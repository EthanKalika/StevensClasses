% This program can calculate the area and diagonal of a rectangle with
% given sides a and b (this is a comment)

% Define a and b

a = 3;
b = 5;

% Calculate the area of the rectangle (omitting ; provides output)

area = area_rectangle(a,b) %(output: area; area_rectangle: function name; a,b: arguments)

% Calculate the diagonal of the rectangle

diagonal = diagonal_rectangle(a,b)
